Just a bare-bones and hard-coded auto-clicker for Minecraft.

Guide: Stand facing where the mobs are delivered and run this program. It assumes pressing shift escapes the auto-click, you are free to modify it for your own server. It simple attacks three times and eats every now and then. You need to make sure your weapon is in slot 1 and your food stack is in slot 2.
